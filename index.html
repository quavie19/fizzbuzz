			//         PROBLEM SOLVING
			// When a user inputs a number
			// Loop from 1 to the entered number
			// If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
			// If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
			// If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
			// Otherwise print the current number

			let answer = parseInt(
				prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to:")
			);

			// Note: We wrapped the prompt call in a parseInt function so that a number is returned from the user’s input.

			for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
				// If you haven’t seen this before and it looks strange, it’s actually straightforward. We declare a variable i and assign it 1: the initial value of the variable i in our loop (NOTE: Most of the time, programmers find themselves looping from 0. Due to the needs of our program, we’re starting from 1). The second clause, i <= answer is our condition. We want to loop until i is greater than answer. The third clause, i++, tells our loop to increment i by 1 every iteration. As a result, if the user inputs 10, this loop would print numbers 1 - 10 to the console.
				if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
					console.log("FizzBuzz");
				} else if (i % 3 === 0) {
					console.log("Fizz");
				} else if (i % 5 === 0) {
					console.log("Buzz");
				} else {
					console.log(i);
				}
			}
